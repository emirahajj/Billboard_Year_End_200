# Billboard Year End 200

At the end of each year, Billboard releases it's Billboard 200 year-end album chart which charts the 200 most popular albums of that chart year.

It's gone through various names and iterations over the years, but the chart in it's essence has been running for the better part of 50 years.

As a self-proclaimed pop culture scholar (and computer science student), I thought it'd be interesting to study the chart data and glean various statistics from them.

The official data is available on the Billboard site, with the help of a trusty drop-down menu that allows searches back to 2002. This limitation is easily bypassed by replacing the chart year you're interested in in the url. [You can give it a try here.](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2019/top-billboard-200-albums)

Upon further inspection, however, there are some gaps in the data:

So, in need of a challenge and a compelling project for my database class, I decided to fill in these blanks using the print versions of the charts. (FYI, there were a lot!)
